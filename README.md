# TADA : Talk About Data Analytics

### Hi, there!
**TADA** is a community of people interested in Data Analytics & Science, and its endless possibilities. :)

Our weekly meet-ups are as follows:
- Every Saturday @ 11 am - (GMT+9)
- Total 10 minutes of presentation for each person
  - 5 min presentation
  - 5 min Q&A sesion

The topic of the week is decided the previous week, and each presentation can vary from the fundamental theories behind the topic, different approaches in evaluation, or the applications of the state-of-the-art models - to each their own! 

We welcome anyone working in a field of Data Science, or wish to know more about ML & AI.
