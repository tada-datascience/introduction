# TADA : Talk About Data Analytics

### Hi, there!
**TADA** is a community of people interested in Data Analytics & Science, and its endless possibilities. :)

We have weekly meetings where each of us present for 5 min on the topic of the week, followed by a 5 min q&a session. The topics vary from fundamental theories of ML and DNN, to different approaches in evaluation and applications of the state-of-the-art models. 


```If you're working in a field of Data Science, or wish to know more about the theory and applications of AI - feel free to join us!```
