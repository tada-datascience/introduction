# TADA : Talk About Data Analytics

### Hi, there!
**TADA** is a community of people interested in Data Analytics & Science, and its endless possibilities. :)

Our weekly meet-ups are as follows:
- Every Saturday @ 11 am - (GMT+9)
- Total 10 minutes of presentation for each person
  - 5 min presentation
  - 5 min Q&A sesion

The theme of the week is voted every week, and there is no format set for each presentation.

The topic can vary from the fundamental theories, different approaches in evaluation or the applications of the state-of-the-art models - to each their own! 

We welcome anyone working in a field of Data Science, or wish to know more about ML & AI. Let us know if you're interested.
